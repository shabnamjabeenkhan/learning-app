# Status: done

# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Next.js 15 using App Router and configure Tailwind CSS for styling.
# Details:
1. Create a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest edubot-ai`
2. Select the following options during setup:
   - Use TypeScript: Yes
   - Use ESLint: Yes
   - Use Tailwind CSS: Yes
   - Use App Router: Yes
   - Import alias: Yes (use @/ as the default)
3. Set up project structure with the following directories:
   - app/ (for App Router pages)
   - components/ (for reusable UI components)
   - lib/ (for utility functions)
   - styles/ (for global styles)
4. Configure Tailwind CSS with a custom theme that matches the product branding
