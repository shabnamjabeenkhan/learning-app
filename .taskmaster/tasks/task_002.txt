# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate Clerk Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Clerk for user authentication, including sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
# Details:
1. Install Clerk SDK: `npm install @clerk/nextjs`
2. Create a Clerk account and set up a new application
3. Configure environment variables in .env.local:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
   ```
4. Wrap the application with ClerkProvider in app/layout.tsx
5. Create middleware.ts to protect routes:
   ```typescript
   import { authMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs';
   export default authMiddleware({
     publicRoutes: ['/', '/api/webhook/clerk']
   });
   export const config = {
     matcher: ['/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
   };
   ```
6. Implement sign-up and sign-in pages using Clerk components
7. Create user onboarding flow after successful sign-up
8. Set up webhook to track user events in Supabase

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user registration flow with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify sign-in functionality with correct and incorrect credentials
3. Confirm that protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
4. Test session persistence across page refreshes
5. Validate that user data is correctly stored in Clerk and synced to Supabase
