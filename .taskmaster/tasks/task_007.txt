# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Quiz UI and Interaction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the user interface for displaying and interacting with quizzes.
# Details:
1. Create a new page component in app/quiz/[id]/page.tsx to display the quiz
2. Implement a Quiz component with the following features:
   - Display questions one at a time with navigation controls
   - Support for multiple-choice questions with radio buttons
   - Support for short-answer questions with text input
   - Progress indicator showing current question and total questions
   - Timer (optional) to track quiz duration
   - Submit button to complete the quiz
3. Use React Query for state management:
   ```typescript
   import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';
   
   // Fetch quiz data
   const { data: quiz, isLoading } = useQuery({
     queryKey: ['quiz', quizId],
     queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/quiz/${quizId}`).then(res => res.json())
   });
   
   // Submit answer
   const submitAnswer = useMutation({
     mutationFn: (answer) => fetch(`/api/quiz/${quizId}/answer`, {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify(answer)
     }).then(res => res.json())
   });
   ```
4. Implement client-side validation for answers
5. Add animations for transitions between questions
6. Create a responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop
7. Implement keyboard shortcuts for navigation and answer selection
8. Add confirmation dialog before quiz submission

# Test Strategy:
1. Test quiz rendering with different question types
2. Verify that answer submission works correctly
3. Test navigation between questions
4. Validate that the quiz state is maintained correctly
5. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
6. Verify that keyboard shortcuts work as expected
7. Test quiz completion and submission flow
