## Key Analysis Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Comprehensive Domain Coverage**: Analyze all 17 domains systematically without gaps
- **Evidence-Based Documentation**: Every improvement must include file paths and code examples
- **Safe Migration Planning**: Assess complexity, backward compatibility, and implementation risk
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate impact, reusability, and maintainability of each improvement

### Success Criteria
- **Complete Analysis**: All domains covered with documented findings
- **Actionable Improvements**: Clear migration tasks created for viable enhancements  
- **Risk Assessment**: Every improvement categorized by complexity and compatibility impact
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Prioritized tasks ready for systematic execution

## Migration Safety Requirements

### Backward Compatibility Rules
- All new features must be opt-in enhancements
- Existing API interfaces must remain unchanged
- Progressive enhancement approach for all improvements
- No breaking changes without explicit deprecation process

### Quality Gates
- Every improvement requires working code example from evolved project
- Migration complexity must be assessed (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Impact evaluation required (High/Medium/Low)
- Testing verification needed for all changes

### Risk Mitigation
- Atomic commits for each improvement
- Rollback procedures documented
- CLI functionality validated after each change
- Generated project compatibility verified

## Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Structural Comparison
- Directory structure analysis and new file discovery
- Package.json dependencies and configuration changes
- High-level architectural differences identification

### Phase 2: Domain-Specific Analysis
- File-by-file comparison for each of the 17 domains
- Pattern extraction and improvement identification
- Code quality assessment and business logic evaluation

### Phase 3: Migration Planning
- Complexity assessment and dependency analysis
- Backward compatibility impact evaluation
- Implementation prioritization and task creation

### Phase 4: Implementation
- Systematic migration following safety patterns
- Testing and validation at each step
- Documentation updates and CLI verification

## Expected Deliverables

### Analysis Documentation
- Comprehensive findings report for each domain
- Code examples and migration recommendations
- Risk assessment and complexity evaluation

### Implementation Tasks
- Prioritized TaskMaster tasks for each viable improvement
- Clear migration instructions and safety guidelines
- Testing requirements and validation procedures

- **vibe-tools repo**: For intelligent code comparison and pattern analysis
- **Git diff tools**: For file-by-file comparison and change tracking
- **Bun**: Package management and script execution analysis
- **Biome**: Code quality and formatting pattern improvements

### Documentation Standards
- All findings logged in TaskMaster subtasks with timestamps
- Code examples must be complete and functional
- Migration instructions must be step-by-step and clear
- Risk assessments must be realistic and actionable

### Validation Requirements
- CLI generation testing after each major change
- Generated project build and functionality verification
- Backward compatibility testing with existing projects
- Performance impact assessment for all optimizations
