## Upgrade Strategy & Safety

### Safety-First Approach
- **Branch Creation**: Create `upgrade/titan-latest` branch before any changes
- **Incremental Application**: Apply improvements one domain at a time
- **Testing Between Changes**: Verify functionality after each domain upgrade
- **Rollback Plan**: Document how to revert each change if issues arise

### Compatibility Assessment
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Identify improvements that might break existing functionality
- **Custom Code Protection**: Preserve project-specific customizations and business logic
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Check for package version conflicts and resolve safely
- **API Compatibility**: Ensure external API integrations continue working

### Selection Criteria
- **Impact vs Risk**: Prioritize high-impact, low-risk improvements
- **Project Relevance**: Only apply improvements relevant to project's current features
- **Maintenance Burden**: Consider ongoing maintenance implications of new patterns
- **Team Familiarity**: Factor in team's ability to maintain new patterns

## Upgrade Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- Clone latest Titan for comparison reference
- Analyze current project structure and customizations  
- Identify applicable improvements from each domain
- Create upgrade tasks with risk assessment and priority

### Phase 2: Safe Upgrade Execution
- Create upgrade branch for safety
- Apply improvements systematically by domain
- Test functionality after each domain upgrade
- Document all changes and decisions made

### Phase 3: Validation & Integration
- Comprehensive testing of upgraded functionality
- Performance benchmarking vs previous version
- Review all changes for completeness and correctness
- Merge to main branch or provide detailed upgrade summary

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup
