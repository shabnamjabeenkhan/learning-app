## Titan Upgrade Workflows

Titan includes bi-directional intelligent upgrade systems for continuous improvement.

### üîÑ Two-Way Upgrade System

#### **Upstream**: Improve Titan from evolved projects (For Creator-use only)
Extract battle-tested improvements from mature projects back to Titan boilerplate.

#### **Downstream**: Upgrade projects with latest Titan (For Titan users)
Apply latest Titan improvements to existing projects safely and selectively.

### Upstream: Analyze Evolved Projects ‚Üí Improve Titan

**Quick Start via Script**:
```bash
# Automated setup via script
bun scripts/upgrade-titan.ts --project-path ./evolved-projects/my-saas-app

# Or via interactive prompt
bun run upgrade-titan
```

**Manual Setup**:
1. **Clone your evolved project** into the Titan workspace:
   ```bash
   mkdir evolved-projects
   git clone <your-evolved-saas-project> ./evolved-projects/my-saas-app
   ```

2. **Create a project-specific PRD** for the analysis:
   ```bash
   cp docs/titan-upgrade-prd-template.txt .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
   # Edit the PRD to replace [PROJECT_NAME], [TIME_SPAN], etc. with your project details
   ```

3. **Start the analysis** with Cursor:
   ```
   "Analyze my-saas-app for Titan upgrades using the PRD"
   ```

### Downstream: Upgrade Your Project with Latest Titan

**Quick Start via Script** (Recommended):
```bash
# From your Titan-based project directory
bun scripts/upgrade-project.ts

# Conservative upgrade focusing on security
bun scripts/upgrade-project.ts --risk-tolerance conservative --domains security,performance

# Dry run to preview changes
bun scripts/upgrade-project.ts --dry-run
```

**Manual Setup**:
1. **Ensure clean repository** (all changes committed):
   ```bash
   git status  # Should be clean
   ```

2. **Create project upgrade PRD**:
   ```bash
   cp docs/project-upgrade-prd-template.txt .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
   # Edit PRD with your project details and risk tolerance
   ```

3. **Start the upgrade** with Cursor:
   ```
   "Upgrade my project to latest Titan using the PRD"
   ```

**Safety Features**:
- üõ°Ô∏è Creates `upgrade/titan-latest` branch for all changes
- üîÑ Easy rollback: `git checkout main && git branch -D upgrade/titan-latest`
- üìä Intelligent compatibility assessment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never overwrites custom business logic

### Analysis Domains

Both workflows systematically analyze **20 domains** including:
- **Core Infrastructure**: Authentication, payments, database, email systems
- **Development Experience**: Scripts, components, configuration, testing
- **Quality & Performance**: Error handling, security, optimization, monitoring  
- **User Experience**: UX patterns, analytics, mobile responsiveness
- **Integrations**: APIs, background jobs, SEO, third-party services
- **Titan-Specific**: CLI improvements, utility patterns, app structure

### Safety-First Approach

All upgrades follow strict **compatibility and safety** rules:

#### **Upstream (To Titan)**:
- ‚úÖ Add new features as opt-in enhancements
- ‚úÖ Maintain existing API interfaces  
- ‚úÖ Progressive enhancement approach
- ‚ùå Never break existing functionality

#### **Downstream (To Projects)**:
- ‚úÖ Selective application based on project needs
- ‚úÖ Branch-based upgrades with easy rollback
- ‚úÖ Incremental testing after each domain
- ‚ùå Never overwrite custom business logic

### How Both Workflows Work

**Upstream (Titan Improvement)**:
1. **Domain Analysis**: Compare evolved project vs current Titan across all domains
2. **Improvement Extraction**: Identify specific code improvements and optimizations  
3. **Migration Planning**: Create safe migration tasks with compatibility assessment
4. **Implementation**: Apply improvements while maintaining backward compatibility

**Downstream (Project Upgrade)**:
1. **Compatibility Assessment**: Compare current project vs latest Titan
2. **Selective Application**: Only apply relevant and safe improvements
3. **Safe Implementation**: Branch-based upgrades with incremental testing
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing before merge or rollback
